Eventual case studies using `msktr` in different settings:

- [ ]&nbsp;[Continuous data](#): Modelling biomass with the zero-augmented Gamma distribution.
- [ ]&nbsp;[Proportional data](#): Modelling % cover with the tail-adjusted Beta distribution.
- [ ]&nbsp;[Random effects](#): Allowing for hierarchical structure such as different local populations.
- [ ]&nbsp;[Temporal effects](#): Allowing for hierarchical structure such as change over time.
- [ ]&nbsp;[Multiple gradients](#): Building a picture of the empirical realised niche with multiple environmental gradients.
- [ ]&nbsp;[Multiple species](#): Comparing community responses to an environmental gradient.
